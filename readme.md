# Chlorophyll-*a* growth window dataset
The scripts within this repository were used to standardize and compile a dataset of *in situ* chlorophyll-*a* data and related water quality data for lakes at or above 40Â° N across the Northern hemisphere. Original data files are not included, but can be found by following the links listed under "Data sources" below. 

The chlorophyll-*a* growth window dataset contains chlorophyll-*a* rate of increase along with  mean water quality variables (i.e., surface water temperature, nutrients, and solar radiation) during periods of rapid algal growth referred to as the _**growth window**_. Growth windows were defined based on the rate of change in the fluctuating chlorophyll-*a* concentration sampled over the year, and categorized as occurring in the spring, summer, or as a "single" growth window when there was one main period of growth. Additional lake parameters were included from the [HydroLAKES](https://hydrosheds./page/hydrolakes) and [HydroATLAS](https://hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas) databases, and trophic status index (TSI) was calculated from chlorophyll-*a* concentrations.

This dataset is intended to be used to explore trends between changing environmental conditions and lake productivity. However, as a compiled dataset, the growth window data is based on lakes samples collected from a variety of organizations with differing methods. Great care was taken to standardize the data and provide all relevant metadata wherever possible. However, it is recommended that the dataset be uniquely subsetted depending on the research question (e.g., for sampling frequency). 

 
## Data sources

*In situ* lake physiochemical data and solar radiation data were collected from open source international, federal, and regional databases between May 2020 and January 2021. A summary of the sources are listed below:

### Additional parameters:
* [Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED2010)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/eros/coastal-changes-and-impacts/gmted2010?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con)
* [HydroLAKES](https://hydrosheds.org/page/hydrolakes)
* [HydroATLAS](https://hydrosheds.org/page/hydroatlas)

## Methods

Growth windows are defined based on the rate of change in chlorophyll-*a* concentration throughout the year after smoothing the annual time series for each lake using the Savitzky-Golay filter [(Savitzky and Golay, 1964)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac60214a047) and flagging optima in the smoothed data using the following functions:

* [scipy.signal savgol_filter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html) 
* [scipy.signal find_peaks](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html#scipy.signal.find_peaks)

Mean values were calculated for all water quality variables sampled during the growth window and are provided in the [daily_mean.csv]() file.

#### Quality assurance

Data files from varying sources were formatted to have consistent units and column headers; we removed all data recorded as below the instrument detection limit and selected years where samples were collected a minimum of 8 times over the ice-free season.

## Software and packages 

All data processing and analyses for this project were implemented using Python (ver. 3.7.6) and QGIS/PYQGIS (ver. 3.14).
