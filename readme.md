## Data sources

In situ chlorophyll-*a* and associated lake physicochemical data were collected from open source international, federal, and regional databases from May 2020 to January 2021.

## Methods

Growth windows are defined based on the rate of change in chlorophyll-*a* concentration throughout the year after smoothing the annual time series for each lake using the Savitzky-Golay filter [(Savitzky and Golay, 1964)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac60214a047) and flagging optima in the smoothed data using the following functions:

* [scipy.signal savgol_filter](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html) 
* [scipy.signal find_peaks](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html#scipy.signal.find_peaks)


	
Mean values were calculated for all water quality variables sampled during the growth window.

##### Quality assurance
We removed all data recorded as below the instrument detection limit and selected years where samples were collected a minimum of 8 times over the ice-free season.

Data files from varying sources were formatted to have consistent units and column headers, and were rounded to daily mean values.

## Software and packages 

All data processing and analyses for this project were implemented using Python (ver. 3.7.6) and QGIS/PYQGIS (ver. 3.14; QGIS.org, 2021).
