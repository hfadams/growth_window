# Chlorophyll-*a* growth window dataset: supplementary files
This folder contains source files used to generate the growth window dataset. *lake\_name\_formatting.csv* and *all_lake_coordinates.csv* files are used for generating the growth window dataset, in addition to the daily mean *in situ* water quality data, which can be found in the [FRDR repository]() along with the growth window dataset.

* [lake_name_formatting.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/lake_name_formatting.csv): conversion of lake names from original sampling location ID to name in the growth window dataset
* [all\_lake\_coords.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/ac46b91a203430bf76440d42d7880bbb072b425e/supplementary_data/all_lake_coordinates.csv): list of coordinates for all lakes in the dataset, used in the growth window calculation scripts. Coordinates were collected from the original data files or searched within the database where possible, otherwise they were estimated based on sampling location name.
* [HydroATLASclimatezones.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/HydroATLASclimatezones.csv): legend for HydroATLAS climate zone values

## Dataset summary
The growth window dataset consists of 3137 rows of unique growth windows with 42 variables/ lake and SSR station parameters. There are 357 lake sampling locations and 30 paired SSR stations ≥ 40°N, monitored between 1964-2019.
