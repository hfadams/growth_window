# Chlorophyll-*a* growth window dataset and associated files
This folder contains the growth window dataset along with the *in situ* data that has been converted to a daily mean and a summary file for all lakes and ssr stations that make up the dataset.

## Folder directory
* growth\_window\_data.csv: Containing water quality and other associated environmental data for 3137 growth windows
* daily_mean.csv: *in situ* water quality data where each variable has been rounded to daily mean (see growth_window_functions.py). Chlorophyll-*a* concentrations within the file are used to generate the growth window dataset
* lake_summary.csv: summary file for all lakes in the growth window dataset; each row provides the lake parameters, monitoring period, data source, and paired SSR station where relevant.

#### Subfolder A: supplementary_data
Data and metadata associated with the growth window dataset (see supplementary data readme.md for more information). 

* growth_window_variable_description.csv
* lake_name_formatting.csv
* database\_summary.csv
* HydroATLASclimatezones.csv

## Dataset summary
The growth window dataset consists of 3137 rows of unique growth windows with 42 variables/ lake and SSR station parameters. There are 357 lake sampling locations and 30 paired SSR stations ≥ 40°N, monitored between 1964-2019.
