# Supplementary data

This folder contains data and metadata associated with the growth window dataset. lake\_name\_formatting.csv and all_lake_coordinates.csv files are used for generating the growth window dataset, in addition to the daily mean *in situ* water quality data.



## Folder directory
* [growth_window_variable_description.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/growth_window_variable_description.csv): Units and description of each variable in the growth window dataset
* [lake_name_formatting.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/lake_name_formatting.csv): conversion of lake names from original sampling location ID to name in the growth window dataset
* [database\_summary.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/lake_database_summary.csv): summary of all databases used for *in situ* water quality and surface solar radiation data collection
* [HydroATLASclimatezones.csv](https://github.com/hfadams/growth_window/blob/662c87faba3d5bd954d160357da87cf4741a9d4c/data/supplementary%20_data/HydroATLASclimatezones.csv): legend for HydroATLAS climate zone values

	**subfolder: shapefiles** 

	Lake and SSR shapefiles can be used to link with HydroATLAS and HydroSHEDS shapefiles. Style files can be used to format the points as seen in figure 1 of the manuscript.

	* lakes.zip: shapefile (and associated files) showing the lake locations and relevant attributes
	* ssr_stations.zip: shapefile (and associated files) showing the SSR station locations and relevant attributes
	* lake_coords.style: QGIS style file that can be used to format the lakes shapefile
	* ssr_coords.style: QGIS style file that can be used to format the SSR station shapefile
