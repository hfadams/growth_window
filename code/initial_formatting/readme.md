# Initial formatting code

These scripts are used for basic formatting of the raw water quality data files downloaded from their original source (link provided at the top of each file and full licensing and citation available in the main repository readme file).


## How to use
These files can either be used to format the data by downloading all necessary csv files from the source or can simply be read to understand the data selection process.

## Disclaimer

Some manual edits were made directly in the csv file; some intuitive editing may be necessary to run certain scripts.
